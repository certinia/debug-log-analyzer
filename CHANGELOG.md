- Support for more undocumented log events such as `NBA_*`, `ORG_CACHE_*`, `SESSION_CACHE_*`, `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_*` and more ([#246][#246]).

### Fixed

- `ENTERING_MANAGED_PKG` events would wrongly have other events rollup into them ([#320][#320]).
  - Note: This now means some events will no longer be rolled up into `ENTERING_MANAGED_PKG`.
  - e.g `SOQL_BEGIN` will be between two `ENTERING_MANAGED_PKG` events instead of nested inside one.
- Database page scrolls up when a grouped row neat bottom of grid is clicked ([#312][#312]).

## [1.6.0] - 2023-05-19

### Added

- Redesigned Database tab ([#219][#219]).
  - All columns are sortable ascending /descending by clicking the header.
  - Added columns DML/ SOQL, Row Count, Total Time.
  - Added specific columns for SOQL Selectivity + Aggregations.
  - Added detail panel which is shown by clicking a row which shows the call stack for the specific DML / SOQL, clicking a link will go to the main call tree tab.
  - The detail panel also shows a list of potential SOQL performance issues.
  - Totals shown at the bottom of each column.
  - SOQL/ DML is grouped by name by default, grouping can be removed to show the SOQL/ DML as a flat list.
- `Log: Show Apex Log Analysis` code lens to the top of the currently open log file ([#199][#199]).
  - This is a faster way to open the analysis.
- Support for more file types when opening the analysis ([#199][#199]).
  - The analysis can now be shown for any `.log` or `.txt` file that starts with the Apex debug log header.
  - e.g `57.0 APEX_CODE,FINE;APEX_PROFILING,FINE;CALLOUT,NONE;DB,FINEST;NBA,INFO;SYSTEM,DEBUG;VALIDATION,INFO;VISUALFORCE,FINE;WAVE,INFO;WORKFLOW,INFO`
- The row count to the timeline tooltip for events which have one e.g `SOQL_EXECUTE_BEGIN`, `DML_BEGIN`, `SOSL_EXECUTE_BEGIN` ([#129][#129]).
- Call Tree - Breadcrumbs shown at the top when clicking a row ([#142][#142]).
- Call Tree - displaying variable value as well as variable names for `VARIABLE_ASSIGNMENT` events ([#235][#235]).
- Call Tree - pretty formatting of JSON in `VARIABLE_ASSIGNMENT` events ([#235][#235]).

### Changed

- Goto code from click to CMD/CTRL and click. Breadcrumbs are shown on click instead ([#142][#142]).
- End time of events that start before `MAXIMUM DEBUG LOG SIZE REACHED` but have no matching end event, will now have their duration end before the `MAXIMUM DEBUG LOG SIZE REACHED` instead of extending to the very end of the log ([#264][#264]).
  - This provides more accurate durations overall because we can not know what occurred during the `MAXIMUM DEBUG LOG SIZE REACHED` gap.

### Fixed

- Timeline not showing events if the event occurs outside the `EXECUTION_STARTED` + `EXECUTION_FINISHED` events ([#180][#180]).
- Timeline incorrectly showing some `VF_APEX_CALL_START` events when dealing with ApexPage messages ([#212][#212]).

## [1.5.1] - 2022-10-04

### Fixed

- Fixes custom timeline event colors not being used from vscode preferences ([#163][#163]).

## [1.5.0] - 2022-08-08

### Added

- Call Tree filtering to hide nodes where total duration is less than a given time ([#112][#112]).
- An `EXCEPTION_THROWN` marker (T) to supplement the`DML_BEGIN` (D) and `SOQL_EXECUTE_BEGIN` (S) markers on parent nodes ([#135][#135]).
- Some missing line types: `DUPLICATE_DETECTION_BEGIN`, `DUPLICATE_DETECTION_END` and `DUPLICATE_DETECTION_RULE_INVOCATION` ([#139][#139]).
- Salesforce Code Builder Support ([#23][#23]).
  - Apex Log Analyzer to be published to the Open VSX Registry as well as the VSCode Marketplace.

### Changed

- Rounded the log size on the `Log: Load Apex Log For Analysis` command results to 2DP ([#91][#91]).
- Improved log parsing to tolerate false exits ([#88][#88]).
  - Checks for false exits before un-winding the call stack, by checking down the stack to see if the EXIT matches something already on the stack.
- Greatly reduced CPU usage when Timeline is open but no changes are occurring ([#90][#90]).
- Improved performance getting log file from an org when using the `Log: Load Apex Log For Analysis` command ([#123][#123]).
- More easily differentiate between "Flows" and "Process Builders" in the timeline and call tree ([#114][#114]).
- Counts on Call Tree for Throw (T), DML (D) & SOQL (S) markers, which shows how many of each statement type are descendants of a node ([#135][#135]).

- Tooltip not hiding when moving to a part of timeline where the tooltip should not be shown ([#131][#131]).
- Timeline background shown as black in some browsers ([#137][#137]).
- The TRUNCATED marker (for methods which were not complete at the end of the log) not being shown ([#135][#135]).
- The hide checkboxes not always un-hiding ([#135][#135]).
- Some NullPointers ([#135][#135]).

## [1.4.2] - 2022-03-14

### Fixed

- Timeline content disappearing when switching tabs + resizing ([#99][#99]).
- Timeline flickering/resizing when tooltip moved to bottom right ([#87][#87]).
- Timeline not displaying `VF_APEX_CALL_START` log events ([#97][#97]).
- Incorrect Total Time on status bar and analysis tab ([#95][#95]).
  - Now uses the timestamp of the last `EXECUTION_FINISHED` event to determine total time.
  - If there are no `EXECUTION_FINISHED` events the last event with a timestamp is used.
- Log parsing not handling both CRLF and LF line endings ([#108][#108]).

## [1.4.1] - 2022-01-06

  - zoom to an accuracy of 0.001ms, time markers are shown with a ms time value and white line e.g 9600.001 ms.
  - scroll up and down on the mouse to zoom in and out.
  - zoom is based on position of mouse pointer, ensuring that position is kept on screen when zoomed in or out.
  - scroll left and right on the mouse to move the time line left are right, when zoomed.
  - click the mouse down and drag to move the timeline around both in the x and y direction, when zoomed.
- Specify custom timeline event colors in vscode preferences ([#66][#66]).
- Support for all [known log event types](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_debugging_system_log_console.htm) ([#81][#81]).
  - Includes events for `Database`, `Workflow`, `NBA`, `Validation`, `Callout`, `Apex Code`, `Apex Profiling`, `Visualforce` and `System` categories.
