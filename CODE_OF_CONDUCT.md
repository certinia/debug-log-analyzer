# Certinia Open Source Community Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We value diversity and inclusion at Certinia. We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other similar personal characteristics.

Diversity also fosters innovation and this Code of Conduct sets standards to enable diverse groups of people to work together effectively, productively, and respectfully in our open source community. It also establishes a mechanism for reporting issues and resolving conflicts.

All questions and reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in a Certinia open-source project may be reported by contacting Certinia Legal at legal@certinia.com.

## Standards for Contributing to a Certinia Open Source Project

Examples of behavior that we encourage, which contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants, which we will not allow, include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Personal attacks, insulting/derogatory comments, or trolling
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing, or threatening to publish, others' private information—such as a physical or electronic address—without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Certinia Legal at legal@certinia.com. All complaints will be reviewed with the Certinia Open Source Committee, as appropriate, and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Legal and the Open Source Committee are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by Legal and our Open Source Committee.
