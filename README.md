## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔥 [Timeline](#-timeline)** – Visualize every method, SOQL query, and DML operation in your Apex logs with an interactive flame chart and minimap navigation.
- **🌲 [Interactive Call Tree](#-call-tree)** – Dive into execution stacks with timing, row counts, and DML/ SOQL metrics.
- **📊 [Apex](#-apex-analysis) + [Database](#%EF%B8%8F-database-analysis) Analysis** – Identify slow-performing SOQL, high-impact DML, and time-heavy Apex methods.
- **📄 [Raw Log Navigation](#-raw-log-navigation)** – Jump between analysis views and raw log files with code folding, hover details, and bidirectional navigation.
- **🧠 Smart Filtering + Sorting** – Focus on what matters: filter by namespace, event type, or duration.

- **📤 Export + Share** – Copy or Export Salesforce debug log insights for analysis or collaboration.

> ✨ Works with any `.log` Salesforce debug log file.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 Install Apex Log Analyzer in VS Code

You can install Apex Log Analyzer directly from Visual Studio Code, the command line, or the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

#### ✅ Option 1: Install via VS Code

1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search for `Apex Log Analyzer`.
3. Click **Install**.

#### 🌐 Option 2: Install from Marketplace

[➡️ Install Apex Log Analyzer on Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=financialforce.lana)

#### 🧪 Option 3: Install via Command Line

```bash
code install financialforce.lana
```

#### ✨ Try the Pre-Release Version

💡 Access experimental features and shape future updates by switching to the Pre-Release Version from the extension banner in VS Code.

## ⚡ How It Works

### Start Analysis

You can analyze logs in two ways:

#### 1. Analyze an Open Log File

- Open a `.log` file in VS Code.
- Run `Log: Show Apex Log Analysis` via:
  - Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`)
  - Top-of-file code lens
  - Right-click menu
  - Editor toolbar button

#### 2. Download a Log from Your Org

Use `Log: Retrieve Apex Log And Show Analysis` from the Command Palette.

## ⚙️ Recommended Debug Log Levels

- Set `APEX_CODE` level to `FINE` or higher — lower levels may omit important execution details.
- Be aware that higher debug levels introduce logging overhead, which can inflate recorded execution times.
- Avoid truncated logs — they can result in incomplete or misleading analysis.
- Recommended settings for a good balance of detail and performance: `APEX_CODE,FINE; APEX_PROFILING,FINE; CALLOUT,INFO; DB,FINEST; NBA,INFO; SYSTEM,DEBUG; VALIDATION,INFO; VISUALFORCE,FINE; WAVE,INFO; WORKFLOW,FINE`

## 🔥 Timeline

The Timeline view shows a live visualization of your Salesforce Apex log execution — including methods, SOQL queries, DML operations, workflows, flows, and more.

- **⚡ Fast** – Blazing-fast zoom, pan, and rendering even on massive logs (500k+ lines).
- **🗺️ Minimap** – Bird's-eye view with skyline density overview, viewport lens, and instant teleport.
- **📊 Governor Limits Strip** – At-a-glance limit usage with traffic light coloring. Expand for detailed step chart.
- **📏 Measure & Zoom** – `Shift+Drag` to measure durations, `Alt/Option+Drag` to area-zoom, precision keyboard controls.
- **🕐 Wall-Clock Time** – Toggle between elapsed and real-time (HH:MM:SS.mmm) on the time axis via the toolbar clock button.

Also: Frame Selection & Navigation, Dynamic Frame Labels, Adaptive Frame Detail, Tooltips, Context Menu, Search & Highlight, 19 Curated Themes.

> 🧠 Great for spotting long-running operations, inefficient queries, and bottlenecks.

## 🌲 Call Tree

Explore nested method calls with performance metrics:

- **Metrics**: Self Time, Total Time, SOQL/DML/Thrown Counts, SOQL/DML/Rows
- **Views**: Use Time Order for sequence, Aggregated for repeated hot paths, Bottom-Up for caller attribution
- **Filter by Namespace, Type or Duration**
- **Toggle Debug-Only + Detail Events**
- **Keyboard Navigation**
- **Click to go to Code** – Jump to the source method in your project

![Call Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certinia/debug-log-analyzer/main/lana/assets/v1.18/lana-calltree.png)

## 🧠 Apex Analysis

See which methods are the slowest, most frequent. or expensive.

- **Group by Type or Namespace**
- **Sort by Duration, Count, Name, Type or Namespace**
- **Filter to specific event types**
- **Copy or Export to CSV**

## 🗄️ Database Analysis

Highlight slow Salesforce SOQL queries, non-selective filters, and DML issues.

- **SOQL + DML Duration, Selectivity, Aggregates, Row Count**
- **Group by Namespace or Query**
- **View the Call Stack**
- **SOQL Optimization Tips**
- **Sort by SOQL or DML, Duration, Selectivity, Aggregates, Row Count**
- **Copy or Export to CSV**

![Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certinia/debug-log-analyzer/main/lana/assets/v1.18/lana-database.png)

## 🔍 Global Search

Search across all visualizations:

- Timeline
- Call Tree
- Analysis
- Database

Quickly step through matches, auto-expand parents, and automatically show timeline tooltips.

## 📄 Raw Log Navigation

Seamlessly navigate between the visual analysis and your raw `.log` files:

- **Show in Raw Log** – Right-click any frame in Timeline or Call Tree → "Show in Log File" to jump to the exact line.
- **Show in Log Analysis** – Hover a raw log line to see metrics and click "Show in Log Analysis" to jump back.
- **Code Folding** – Collapse/expand matching start/end events (METHOD_ENTRY/EXIT, DML_BEGIN/END, etc.) using the gutter icons or `Ctrl+Shift+[`/`]`.
- **Line Decorations** – Duration appears as ghost text at the end of the cursor line (e.g., `1.23s (self: 45ms)`).
- **Hover Details** – Hover near the ghost text to see SOQL/DML counts, row counts, and exception info.
- **Total Duration** – First line displays total log execution time.

## 🎨 Customization

Adjust event colors in `settings.json`:

```json
"lana.timeline.customThemes": {
  "Glacial Warmth": {
    "apex": "#6882A6",
    "codeUnit": "#7A9B6E",
    "system": "#9E8E7C",
    "automation": "#D98650",
    "dml": "#C85A5A",
    "soql": "#57A89A",
