### Zoom + pan

- Scroll up and down with the mouse to zoom in and out to an accuracy of 0.001ms, time markers are shown with a ms time value and white line e.g 9600.001 ms.

Hovering over an element provides information on the item. If you click on an item it will take you to that row in the Call Tree.

The tooltip provides the following information.\
**Event Name** - e.g `METHOD_ENTRY`, `EXECUTION_STARTED`, `SOQL_EXECUTION_BEGIN` etc\
**Event Description** - Additional information about the event such as method name or SOQL query executed.\
**Timestamp** - The start and end timestamp for the given event which can be cross referenced in the log file.\
**Duration** - Made up of **Total Time** (time spent in that event and its children) and **Self Time** (time directly spent in that event).\
**Rows** - Shows **Total Rows** (rows from that event and its children) and **Self Rows** (rows directly from that event).
